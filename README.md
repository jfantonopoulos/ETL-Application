# ETL-Application
This program was made for my Introduction to Data Science class I took in college. It extracted, transformed, and loaded data from a dataset to be analyzed and plotted.

The dataset for this project came in a zip file that contained a .json file for each senator which I believe had most if not all the tweets for the 115th congress up between 2015 and 2019. The parties were separated by folder, so it was easy to identify their party. I extracted the data using a custom application I made that I will provide with this submission including the source code.
